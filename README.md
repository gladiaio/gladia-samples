# Gladia Sample Repository

This repo contains gladia samples for several languages. Feel free to do a PR to add yours, we will add more languages in the future.

All language aim to have 2 minimalist examples :

- [Pre-recorded](https://docs.gladia.io/reference/pre-recorded "Pre-recorded") (You have an audio file that you'd like to transcribe)
- [Live transcription](https://docs.gladia.io/reference/live-audio "Live transcription") (You'd like to have a live transcription of a file/audio stream)

All example are using `audio/text/audio-transcription` endpoint, but you can change this to `video/text/video-transcription` endpoint if you are using videos.
Keep in mind that parameters are `video` and `video_url` instead of `audio` and `audio_url` if you want to use `video/text/video-transcription` endpoint.

You can still check the full documentation [here](https://docs.gladia.io/reference/introduction "here")
